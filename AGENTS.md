# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, but it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`.

## Vite+ Workflow

`vp` is a global binary that handles the full development lifecycle. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

### Start

- create - Create a new project from a template
- migrate - Migrate an existing project to Vite+
- config - Configure hooks and agent integration
- staged - Run linters on staged files
- install (`i`) - Install dependencies
- env - Manage Node.js versions

### Develop

- dev - Run the development server
- check - Run format, lint, and TypeScript type checks
- lint - Lint code
- fmt - Format code
- test - Run tests

### Execute

- run - Run monorepo tasks
- exec - Execute a command from local `node_modules/.bin`
- dlx - Execute a package binary without installing it as a dependency
- cache - Manage the task cache

### Build

- build - Build for production
- pack - Build libraries
- preview - Preview production build

### Manage Dependencies

Vite+ automatically detects and wraps the underlying package manager such as pnpm, npm, or Yarn through the `packageManager` field in `package.json` or package manager-specific lockfiles.

- add - Add packages to dependencies
- remove (`rm`, `un`, `uninstall`) - Remove packages from dependencies
- update (`up`) - Update packages to latest versions
- dedupe - Deduplicate dependencies
- outdated - Check for outdated packages
- list (`ls`) - List installed packages
- why (`explain`) - Show why a package is installed
- info (`view`, `show`) - View package information from the registry
- link (`ln`) / unlink - Manage local package links
- pm - Forward a command to the package manager

### Maintain

- upgrade - Update `vp` itself to the latest version

These commands map to their corresponding tools. For example, `vp dev --port 3000` runs Vite's dev server and works the same as Vite. `vp test` runs JavaScript tests through the bundled Vitest. The version of all tools can be checked using `vp --version`. This is useful when researching documentation, features, and bugs.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using the package manager directly:** Do not use pnpm, npm, or Yarn directly. Vite+ can handle all package manager operations.
- **Always use Vite commands to run tools:** Don't attempt to run `vp vitest` or `vp oxlint`. They do not exist. Use `vp test` and `vp lint` instead.
- **Running scripts:** Vite+ built-in commands (`vp dev`, `vp build`, `vp test`, etc.) always run the Vite+ built-in tool, not any `package.json` script of the same name. To run a custom script that shares a name with a built-in command, use `vp run <script>`. For example, if you have a custom `dev` script that runs multiple services concurrently, run it with `vp run dev`, not `vp dev` (which always starts Vite's dev server).
- **Do not install Vitest, Oxlint, Oxfmt, or tsdown directly:** Vite+ wraps these tools. They must not be installed directly. You cannot upgrade these tools by installing their latest versions. Always use Vite+ commands.
- **Use Vite+ wrappers for one-off binaries:** Use `vp dlx` instead of package-manager-specific `dlx`/`npx` commands.
- **Import JavaScript modules from `vite-plus`:** Instead of importing from `vite` or `vitest`, all modules should be imported from the project's `vite-plus` dependency. For example, `import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plus';` or `import { expect, test, vi } from 'vite-plus/test';`. You must not install `vitest` to import test utilities.
- **Type-Aware Linting:** There is no need to install `oxlint-tsgolint`, `vp lint --type-aware` works out of the box.

## CI Integration

For GitHub Actions, consider using [`voidzero-dev/setup-vp`](https://github.com/voidzero-dev/setup-vp) to replace separate `actions/setup-node`, package-manager setup, cache, and install steps with a single action.

```yaml
- uses: voidzero-dev/setup-vp@v1
  with:
    cache: true
- run: vp check
- run: vp test
```

## Review Checklist for Agents

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to validate changes.

# Tauri v2 — Desktop App Development

Lore Designer is a **Tauri v2** desktop application. Tauri runs a Rust backend as the native process and serves the frontend (React + TypeScript) inside a WebView. The two sides communicate exclusively through **Commands** (frontend → Rust) and **Events** (Rust → frontend or frontend → frontend).

| Embedding extra files (resources) | <https://v2.tauri.app/develop/resources> |

## Running the App

**Never run `vite` or `cargo` directly.** Use the Tauri CLI, which coordinates both processes:

```bash
# Development (starts Vite dev server + Rust watcher simultaneously)
vp run tauri dev

# Production build
vp run tauri build
```

Internally `tauri dev` does:
1. Starts the Vite dev server (`vp dev`) on the configured port.
2. Compiles the Rust crate in debug mode (`cargo build`).
3. Spawns the native window pointing at `http://localhost:<port>`.

Any change to a `.rs` file triggers a Rust recompile. Frontend hot-reload works normally via Vite HMR.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Frontend unit tests (Vitest via Vite+)
vp test

# Rust unit tests
cargo test --workspace

# Rust tests for a specific crate
cargo test -p lore-editor
cargo test -p lore-workspaces
```

Frontend tests that exercise Tauri commands must mock the `@tauri-apps/api` module — see the **Mocking** section below.

```

## Tauri Commands — Pattern

Commands are the **only** way the frontend calls Rust. Keep command handlers thin; real logic lives in `lore-editor` / `lore-workspaces` crates.

**Rust side (`src-tauri/src/commands/`):**

```rust
// commands/workspace.rs
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn open_workspace(
    path: String,
    state: tauri::State<'_, AppState>,
) -> Result<WorkspaceManifest, String> {
    lore_workspaces::open(&path, &state.db)
        .await
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())
}
```

Register in `lib.rs`:
```rust
tauri::Builder::default()
    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![
        commands::workspace::open_workspace,
    ])
```

**Frontend side:**
```typescript
import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';

const manifest = await invoke<WorkspaceManifest>('open_workspace', { path });
```

Return types must implement `serde::Serialize` (Rust → TS). Arguments must implement `serde::Deserialize`. Mirror the shape in `@lore/shared` as TypeScript types.

## Tauri Events — Pattern

Use events for **Rust-initiated push** (e.g., file watcher notifying the frontend of external changes).

**Rust → Frontend:**
```rust
// Emit from anywhere that has an AppHandle
app_handle.emit("file:changed", FileChangedPayload { path, kind })?;
```

**Frontend listener:**
```typescript
import { listen } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';

const unlisten = await listen<FileChangedPayload>('file:changed', (event) => {
    store.handleExternalChange(event.payload);
});
// Call unlisten() on component unmount
```

## State Management (Rust Side)

Shared mutable state across command handlers uses `tauri::State<T>` backed by `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or `Arc<RwLock<T>>`.

```rust
// state.rs
pub struct AppState {
    pub db: Arc<Mutex<rusqlite::Connection>>,
    pub watcher_tx: Arc<Mutex<Option<Sender<WatcherCommand>>>>,
}
```

Register in `lib.rs`:
```rust
.manage(AppState {
    db: Arc::new(Mutex::new(open_db()?)),
    watcher_tx: Arc::new(Mutex::new(None)),
})
```

## Permissions & Capabilities

Tauri v2 requires explicit capability declarations for any filesystem, shell, or dialog access. Files live in `src-tauri/capabilities/`.

```json
{
  "identifier": "workspace-access",
  "description": "Read/write workspace directories",
  "permissions": [
    "fs:read-all",
    "fs:write-all",
    "dialog:open",
    "dialog:save"
  ]
}
```

If a command fails silently in production but works in dev, check capabilities first.

## Mocking Tauri APIs in Frontend Tests

Tauri APIs (`invoke`, `listen`, etc.) are not available in the Vitest environment. Mock them:

```typescript
// src/__mocks__/@tauri-apps/api/core.ts
import { vi } from 'vite-plus/test';

export const invoke = vi.fn();
```

```typescript
// In a test file
import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';
import { vi, expect, test } from 'vite-plus/test';

vi.mock('@tauri-apps/api/core');

test('open_workspace returns manifest', async () => {
    vi.mocked(invoke).mockResolvedValueOnce({ name: 'Test', version: 1 });
    // ... test component or composable
});
```

## SQLite Index

The SQLite database (`lore-editor` crate) is a **disposable cache** — never the source of truth. The filesystem is authoritative. The DB is rebuilt from file `mtime` comparisons on startup. WAL mode is enabled to allow concurrent reads from the file watcher thread and command handlers.

Delete the DB file and restart the app to force a full reindex. Tests that touch the DB should use an in-memory connection (`rusqlite::Connection::open_in_memory()`).

## File Format Conventions

All content is standard `.md` files with YAML frontmatter. The `type` field in frontmatter — not the filename — determines content type.

```markdown
---
type: character
name: Arín el Valiente
status: alive
faction: Free Cities
tags: [human, warrior]
---

## Biography

...
```

Configuration files use TOML (`.lore` workspace manifest, `settings.toml`). JSON is reserved for future post-MVP tools (canvas, timelines).

## Common Pitfalls

- **`tauri-plugin-sql` is explicitly NOT used.** It routes DB access through the frontend and places the DB in the app config dir instead of per-workspace. Use `rusqlite` directly in `lore-editor`.
- **Log emissions during Tauri setup fire before the frontend mounts.** Delay startup events with `tauri::async_runtime::spawn` + `tokio::time::sleep` if the frontend needs to receive them.
- **File watcher events are the single source of change notifications.** Do not add a separate diff layer on top — the watcher already emits granular events.
- **Command handlers must be `async`** if they lock a `Mutex` or call async crate functions, to avoid blocking the main thread.
- **`tauri::command` serialization errors surface as generic JS errors.** Add `#[derive(Debug)]` to error types and use `.map_err(|e| e.to_string())` until a proper error enum is in place.

# Lore Designer — Project Context

## What It Is

An offline-first desktop app for writers and worldbuilders. Think of it as the midpoint between Obsidian (too much DIY) and World Anvil (too rigid and online). Users get structured templates and a visual inspector on top of plain `.md` files they own forever.

Platforms: **Linux and Windows** (initial targets).

## Core Philosophy

- **File Over App:** Data lives as Markdown files on disk. The app is a structured layer on top, not a database. Users can open their workspace in any editor (VS Code, Neovim, Obsidian) and everything still works.
- **Offline first.** No accounts, no sync, no subscriptions.
- **Open formats.** Files are readable without Lore Designer in 20 years.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript |
| Styling | TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui |
| State | Zustand (or TanStack Query for async) |
| Backend | Rust via Tauri v2 |
| Content parsing | `lore-editor` crate (gray-matter, rusqlite) |
| Workspace ops | `lore-workspaces` crate |
| Shared types | `@lore/shared` (pure TS, no framework deps) |
| Build | Vite+ (pnpm monorepo) |

## Workspace File Structure

```
MyProject/
├── MyProject.lore            # TOML manifest (name, version, created_at)
├── .lore/
│   ├── settings.toml         # User preferences for this workspace
│   └── state.json            # Last open files, scroll positions (disposable)
├── Characters/
│   └── MainHero.md
├── Locations/
│   └── StartingVillage.md
├── Lore/
│   └── AncientProphecy.md
└── Notes/
    └── LooseIdeas.md
```

## MVP Feature Scope

1. **Workspace management** — create, open, recent workspaces.
2. **File browser sidebar** — mirrors the real directory tree.
3. **Rich text editor** — Markdown with a Notion-like `/` command menu. Frontmatter is hidden by default; a "source" toggle reveals it.
4. **Properties inspector panel** — reads frontmatter fields and renders them as a form. Edits write back to the file.
5. **File templates** — default templates for `character`, `location`, `lore`. Users can create custom types by defining a new `type` value and frontmatter schema.
6. **Dynamic Query View** — SQL-like queries across the workspace (`SHOW Characters WHERE faction = "Empire"`). Powered by the SQLite index in `lore-editor`.

Post-MVP (do not implement now): Timelines, Canvas/connection board, plugin system, mobile app.

## Architectural Rules

### The Shared Boundary

- Types, validation schemas, and frontmatter parsing rules → `packages/shared` (`@lore/shared`).
- `apps/desktop` imports from `@lore/shared`.
- `@lore/shared` never imports from `apps/desktop` or any Tauri/browser API.

### Frontend ↔ Rust Contract

- All file I/O goes through Tauri commands. The frontend never touches the filesystem directly.
- Rust structs that cross the boundary must mirror TypeScript types in `@lore/shared`.
- Unidirectional data flow: **Rust → store → UI components**. Components do not write directly to Rust state.

### Content Type Identification

Content type is determined by the `type` field in frontmatter, not by filename. A file named `Hero.md` is a character because it has `type: character` in its frontmatter. This is intentional for maximum interoperability with external editors.

### Extensibility

Avoid hardcoding logic that would prevent future plugin hooks. Register commands, panel types, and template renderers through a registry pattern rather than hardcoded switches. This keeps the plugin architecture viable without over-engineering it now.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Do not use `tauri-plugin-sql`.
- Do not encode content type in filenames (no `Hero.character.md`).
- Do not store canonical data in SQLite — it is always a cache.
- Do not write business logic inside Tauri command handlers — they delegate to crates.
- Do not add frontend dependencies without checking if VueUse, native React APIs, or existing libraries already cover it.
- Do not add Rust dependencies without checking if `std` or existing workspace crates cover it.
