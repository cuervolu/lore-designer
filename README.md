## Early Development - Not Ready for Use

**Warning:** Lore Designer is currently in very early development and MVP phase. The application is not ready for production use and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or breaking changes. Use at your own risk.

## What is Lore Designer?

Lore Designer is an offline desktop application that helps writers and developers plan and write their stories. It's a personal knowledge management tool designed specifically for worldbuilding and creative writing.

### Who Is This For?

- **Writers** (novels, screenplays)
- **Indie game developers**
- **Narrative content creators**

### What Problem Does It Solve?

The difficulty of keeping complex creative project information organized in one place, offline, with complete user control over their data.

### Core Philosophy

- **Offline first** - Your work stays on your machine
- **User owns their data** - Plain text formats you can access anywhere
- **Flexible structure** - Adapt to your creative process
- **Open Source** - Transparent and community-driven

## Why Is Lore Designer Different?

Lore Designer positions itself between two extremes in the market:

**"Absolute Freedom" Tools** (like note-taking apps): These are toolboxes that require technical setup, plugin installation, and configuration before you can start creating. High barrier to entry for non-technical writers.

**"Rigid Structure" Platforms** (like online worldbuilding services): These provide predefined forms and templates but are inflexible, online-only, subscription-based, and you don't own your data in a simple format.

**Lore Designer bridges this gap** by providing:

1. **Immediate productivity** - Start creating structured characters and locations right away using default templates
2. **Intuitive customization** - Modify templates visually without writing code
3. **True data ownership** - 100% open source, offline, using plain text formats (`.md`, `.toml`) that will be readable in 20 years

## Key Features

- **Workspace Management** - Organize your creative projects
- **Structured Content** - Characters, locations, lore, and dialogue templates
- **Flexible Organization** - Adapt the structure to your needs
- **Offline First** - No internet required, your data stays local
- **Plain Text Storage** - Future-proof file formats
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows and Linux, with macOS support planned
